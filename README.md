# odin-recipes

Hello! This is my first Odin project using HTML and gitHub
I got a little bit frustrated but I think it's okay
Frustration shows commitment and achieving a higher level
Also I hope the project turns out okay
I have problems with understanding git/gitHUB 
My HTML is okay, and I will learn git too
That's all I guess... Wish me luck

PS. The project is a website about recipes
I will probably use lists, paragraphs, links and pictures
I will do my best to make it as appealing as possible
